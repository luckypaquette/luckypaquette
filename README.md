- 👋 Hi, I’m @luckypaquette
- 👀 I’m interested in Sciences & technologies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming as I enrolled in the computer sciences program at Cégep Lévis
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate ideally, in any project that would be likely to influence and  to create have meaningful, positive socio-cultural impact;
-  alleviate with solutions capable of positive change from an inclusive and hollistic problem-solving approach.  Although, for the moment, any "Hello World"
-  project would suffice and would be more likely to reflect my computer skills at the time.
- 📫 How to reach me... By Email:lucky.paquette@gmail.com
