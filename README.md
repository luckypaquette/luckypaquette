- 👋 Hi, I’m @luckypaquette
- 👀 I’m interested in Sciences & technologies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming as I enrolled in the computer sciences program at Cégep Lévis, located in Lévis, Québec, Canada.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate ideally, in any project likely to influence and/or to create meaningful socio-cultural impact by providing alternatives through an  inclusive and holistic design approach.  Although, for the moment being, a simple "Hello World" project would suffice to reflect my current computer skills.
- 📫 How to reach me... By Email: lucky.paquette@gmail.com   on Discord: Lucky pocket#8501
